## 🚀 How to Run

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install earthengine-api geemap pandas matplotlib folium numpy
```

2. **Authenticate Earth Engine** (one-time only):
```python
import ee
ee.Authenticate()
```

3. **Run the script**:
```bash
python deforestation_detector.py
```

### Using the Setup Script

```bash
python setup_and_test.py
```

This will:
- Check all dependencies
- Verify Earth Engine authentication
- Validate the CSV file
- Install missing packages (if you agree)
- Confirm everything is ready

## 🔄 Ready for Milestone 2

The code is designed to be easily modified. For Milestone 2 ("Make any fixes"), you can easily:

### Possible Modifications

1. **Change Analysis Period**
```python
detector = DeforestationDetector(start_year=2010, end_year=2023)
```

2. **Adjust Buffer Size**
```python
geometry = detector.create_buffer_polygon(lat, lon, buffer_km=10)
```

3. **Modify Deforestation Threshold**
```python
# In analyze_deforestation() method
deforestation_detected = change_percentage < -10  # More sensitive
```

4. **Add More Vegetation Indices**
```python
def calculate_evi(self, image):
    # Enhanced Vegetation Index
    # Code structure already supports this
```

5. **Export Data to CSV**
```python
df.to_csv('ndvi_results.csv', index=False)
```

6. **Change Cloud Cover Threshold**
```python
.filter(ee.Filter.lt('CLOUD_COVER', 10))  # Stricter filtering
```

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Testing

1. **Start with the setup script** to verify everything works
2. **Use simple_example.py** to understand the core workflow
3. **Then use deforestation_detector.py** for full analysis

### For Your Own Locations

1. Edit `locations.csv` with your coordinates
2. Make sure coordinates are in decimal degrees
3. Western longitudes are negative (e.g., -122.1567)
4. Keep buffer size appropriate (5-10 km works well)

### Common Issues

- **No images found**: Location too cloudy or not enough coverage
  - Solution: Expand date range or try different season
  
- **Authentication error**: Need to run `ee.Authenticate()` first
  - Solution: Follow Google's authentication prompts
  
- **Memory error**: Too many images or large buffer
  - Solution: Reduce buffer size or shorten date range

---

## 📈 Expected Performance

- **Processing Time**: ~3-5 minutes per location
- **Image Count**: 100-200 images per location (10 years)
- **Output Size**: 2-5 MB total
- **Accuracy**: Excellent for areas > 100m (3-4 pixels)
