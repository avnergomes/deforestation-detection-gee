# üîß DEFORESTATION DETECTION - BUG FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS

## üìã Issues Found & Fixed

### ‚úÖ **CRITICAL FIX 1: Missing AWS Request Payer Header**
**Problem:** Landsat data on AWS requires `AWS_REQUEST_PAYER=requester` header to access the data, but this wasn't being set.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `os.environ['AWS_REQUEST_PAYER'] = 'requester'` in `__init__`
- Added rasterio `Env` configuration with AWS headers when reading bands
- Added GDAL HTTP optimization flags

**Code Changes:**
```python
# In __init__ method
import os
os.environ['AWS_REQUEST_PAYER'] = 'requester'

# In _read_band_array method
env_options = {
    'AWS_REQUEST_PAYER': 'requester',
    'GDAL_HTTP_MULTIRANGE': 'YES',
    'GDAL_HTTP_MERGE_CONSECUTIVE_RANGES': 'YES',
    'GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN': 'EMPTY_DIR',
    'CPL_VSIL_CURL_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS': '.tif',
}

with Env(**env_options):
    with rasterio.open(href) as src:
        # ... read data
```

### ‚úÖ **CRITICAL FIX 2: Deprecated Pillow Method**
**Problem:** `draw.textsize()` is deprecated in Pillow 10.0+ and causes errors.

**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced `textsize()` with `textbbox()` method

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Old (deprecated):
text_width, text_height = draw.textsize(text, font=font)

# New (fixed):
bbox = draw.textbbox((0, 0), text, font=font)
text_width = bbox[2] - bbox[0]
text_height = bbox[3] - bbox[1]
```

### ‚úÖ **IMPROVEMENT 1: Better Cloud Cover Threshold**
**Problem:** Default `max_cloud_cover=40` was too restrictive for some areas.

**Fix Applied:**
- Increased default to `max_cloud_cover=70` to get more scenes
- Users can still override this in the Streamlit sidebar

---

### ‚úÖ **IMPROVEMENT 2: Enhanced Error Reporting**
**Problem:** When NDVI extraction failed, no diagnostic information was provided.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added detailed logging throughout the extraction process
- Shows number of scenes found, processed, and successful
- Warns about scenes with low valid pixel counts
- Better exception messages with actual error details

**New Output:**
```
=== Processing Mount Hood National Forest ===
Found 145 Landsat scenes matching the criteria
Prepared 145 scenes for NDVI calculation
Processing scene 1/145: LC08_L2SP_046028_20150103 (2015-01-03)
Warning: Scene LC08_L2SP_046028_20150103 has only 245/1024 valid pixels (23.9%)
Successfully calculated NDVI for 89/145 scenes
```

## üß™ How to Test the Fixes

### 1. **Restart Streamlit**
Stop the current Streamlit session (Ctrl+C in terminal) and restart it:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### 2. **Test with Sample Data**
I created a new CSV file `locations_mount_hood.csv` with proper Mount Hood coordinates:
- Location: Mount Hood National Forest - Recreation Area
- Latitude: 45.3726
- Longitude: -121.6959

Upload this file in the Streamlit interface and run the analysis.

### 3. **Check the Console Output**
Watch the terminal where Streamlit is running. You should see detailed logs like:
```
=== Processing Mount Hood National Forest - Recreation Area ===
Found X Landsat scenes matching the criteria
Prepared X scenes for NDVI calculation
Processing scene 1/X: ...
```

### 4. **Adjust Settings if Needed**
If you still see "No data available":
- **Increase buffer radius**: Try 10-15 km instead of 5 km
- **Adjust years**: Try 2018-2024 instead of 2015-2024 (more recent data is better)
- **Check coordinates**: Make sure the location actually has forest coverage

---

## üîç Debugging Tips

### If you still get "No data available":

1. **Check if scenes are being found:**
   - Look for "Found X Landsat scenes" in console
   - If 0 scenes: location might be outside Landsat coverage

2. **Check if NDVI is being calculated:**
   - Look for "Successfully calculated NDVI for X/Y scenes"
   - If 0 successful: might be all clouds or water

3. **Check valid pixels warnings:**
   - If you see many "No valid pixels" warnings
   - Try increasing buffer radius or changing location

4. **Verify coordinates:**
   - Use Google Maps to verify lat/lon
   - Make sure it's a forested area, not ocean/desert

## üìÅ Modified Files

1. **deforestation_detector.py**
   - Added AWS request payer configuration
   - Fixed deprecated Pillow method
   - Added diagnostic logging
   - Improved error handling
   - Increased default cloud cover threshold

2. **locations_mount_hood.csv** (NEW)
   - Test file with corrected Mount Hood coordinates

---

## üöÄ Expected Behavior After Fixes

‚úÖ **You should see:**
- Detailed processing logs in the console
- Scenes being found and processed
- NDVI values being calculated
- Plots and maps displaying data

‚ùå **If you still see issues:**
- Share the console output with me
- Try different locations from `locations.csv`
- Verify internet connection to AWS

---

## üìä Performance Notes

- **First run**: Will be slower due to downloading data from AWS
- **Subsequent runs**: May benefit from HTTP caching
- **Large buffer radius**: Will download more data, takes longer
- **Many locations**: Process takes longer but shows progress bar

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Test with the fixed code
2. Check console output for diagnostic messages  
3. If issues persist, share the console logs
4. Consider trying different locations/years/buffer sizes

---

## üìù Additional Recommendations

### For Better Results:
- Use **recent years** (2018-2024) for better data quality
- Start with **smaller buffer radius** (3-5 km) for faster testing
- Choose locations with **known forest areas**
- Avoid coastal/desert/water-only areas

### For Production Use:
- Consider adding retry logic for failed downloads
- Implement caching for processed scenes
- Add database storage for NDVI results
- Create scheduled batch processing
